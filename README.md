## How to Play Battleship:

A brief synopsis if you're not familiar with the game battleship: 

The game battleship is a 2 player game, where each player has a total of 5 seperate ships of varying lengths that they must place anywhere on their gameboard. Players take turns calling out a location on their opponent's board, to launch an attack. Players announce 'hit' when their opponent's guess hits one of their ships, or "miss". Gameplay concludes when one player successfully sinks all of their opponent's ships.
