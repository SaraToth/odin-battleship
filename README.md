## How to Play Battleship:

The game battleship is a 2 player game, where each player has a total of 5 seperate ships that they must place anywhere on their gameboard. Players take turns calling out a location on the board, to guess whether their opponent has a ship located there. Generally 'hit' means there is a ship there, and 'miss'is what is said when nothing is located there.
